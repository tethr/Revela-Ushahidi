* Lets you see all reports (approved and unapproved) on a map on the backend of the website.

* Lets you print maps, using CSS black magic, and if you're using a map layer that allows you 
to manipulate the tiles on the server, you can print via the server. you can access this via
/printmap. It's still under development, so please give feed back and keep checking in

* Lets you embedd your map. It'll create a text box on the home page that has the embedd HTML.
